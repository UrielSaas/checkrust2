# Tock OS Course Part 1: Getting your environment set up

The goal of this part of the course is to make sure you have a working
development environment for Tock.

During this you will:

...

## 1. Presentation: Tock's goals, architecture and components (10 min)

## 2. Check your understanding (10 min)

1. What kinds of binaries exist on a Tock board? Hint: There are three, and
   only two can be programmed using `tockloader`.

2. What are the differences between capsules and processes? What performance
   and memory overhead does each entail? Why would you choose to write
   something as a process instead of a capsule and vice versa?

## 3. Compile and flash the kernel (10 min)

## 4. Customize, compile and flash the `ble-env-sense` service (10 min)

## 5. (Optional) Familiarize yourself with `tockloader` commands (10 min)
