//! Data structures for passing application memory to the kernel.
//!
//! A Tock process can pass read-write or read-only buffers into the kernel for
//! it to use. The kernel checks that read-write buffers exist within a
//! process's RAM address space, and that read-only buffers exist either within
//! its RAM or flash address space. These buffers are shared with the
//! `allow_readwrite()` and `allow_readonly()` system calls. Refer to [TRD 104
//! -- Syscalls][1] for more information.
//!
//! A read-write and read-only call is mapped to the high-level Rust types
//! [`ReadWriteProcessBuffer`] and [`ReadOnlyProcessBuffer`] respectively. The
//! memory regions can be accessed through the [`ReadableProcessBuffer`] and
//! [`WriteableProcessBuffer`] traits, implemented on the process buffer
//! structs.
//!
//! Each access to the buffer structs requires a liveness check to ensure that
//! the process memory is still valid. For a more traditional interface, users
//! can convert buffers into [`ReadableProcessSlice`] or
//! [`WriteableProcessSlice`] and use these for the lifetime of their
//! operations. Users cannot hold live-lived references to these slices,
//! however.
