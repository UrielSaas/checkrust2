At the end of the SenSys 2018 tutorial, attendees should be able to:

1) Set up an Imix board, compile Tock and flash, compile applications,
   and install applications.

2) Use the process management capsule to inspect the state of multiple running
   processes, detect a misbehaving application, and stop its execution without
   interrupting other processes on the board.

3) Understand the Tock process/Syscall model well enough to identify apps that
   fail to yield the processor fairly.

4) Build apps that communicate over 802.15.4/6lowpan/IPv6

5) Build an app that advertises sensor data over 6LoWPAN to another Imix
    acting as a server

6) Do at least one of the following (depending on how they spend the last two
   hours):

  a) Add a new capsule to the kernel (write it, include it in the crate,
     initialize it in a boot sequence).

  b) Write a system call interface to a capsule.

  c) Write a new chip driver for a (chip) peripheral.
     - Maybe not, but understanding unsafe use here is important.

  d) Write down/diagram what happens when a process makes a blocking
     system call (context switch, interrupt setup, wait_for, interrupt
     handling, kernel thread, resuming process).
