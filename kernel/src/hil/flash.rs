//! Interfaces for reading, writing, and erasing flash storage pages as
//! well as querying the layout and locking/unlocking lock units. A
//! lock unit consists of one or more pages.
//!
//! Read, write and erase operate on single pages. The page size is
//! set by the associated type `page`. Here is an example of a page
//! type:
//!
//! ```rust
//! // Size in bytes
//! const PAGE_SIZE: u32 = 1024;
//!
//! pub struct NewChipPage(pub [u8; PAGE_SIZE as usize]);
//!
//! impl NewChipPage {
//!     pub const fn new() -> NewChipPage {
//!         NewChipPage([0; PAGE_SIZE as usize])
//!     }
//!
//!     fn len(&self) -> usize {
//!         self.0.len()
//!     }
//! }
//!
//! impl Index<usize> for NewChipPage {
//!     type Output = u8;
//!
//!     fn index(&self, idx: usize) -> &u8 {
//!         &self.0[idx]
//!     }
//! }
//!
//! impl IndexMut<usize> for NewChipPage {
//!     fn index_mut(&mut self, idx: usize) -> &mut u8 {
//!         &mut self.0[idx]
//!     }
//! }
//!
//! impl AsMut<[u8]> for NewChipPage {
//!     fn as_mut(&mut self) -> &mut [u8] {
//!         &mut self.0
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Then a basic implementation of this trait should look like:
//!
//! ```rust
//!
//! impl hil::flash::HasClient for NewChipStruct {
//!     fn set_client(&'a self, client: &'a C) { }
//! }
//!
//! impl hil::flash::Flash for NewChipStruct {
//!     type Page = NewChipPage;
//!
//!     fn read_page(&self, page_number: usize, buf: &'static mut Self::Page) -> ReturnCode { }
//!     fn write_page(&self, page_number: usize, buf: &'static mut Self::Page) -> ReturnCode { }
//!     fn erase_page(&self, page_number: usize) -> ReturnCode { }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! A user of this flash interface might look like:
//!
//! ```rust
//! pub struct FlashUser<'a, F: hil::flash::Flash + 'static> {
//!     driver: &'a F,
//!     buffer: TakeCell<'static, F::Page>,
//! }
//!
//! impl<'a, F: hil::flash::Flash + 'a> FlashUser<'a, F> {
//!     pub fn new(driver: &'a F, buffer: &'static mut F::Page) -> FlashUser<'a, F> {
//!         FlashUser {
//!             driver: driver,
//!             buffer: TakeCell::new(buffer),
//!         }
//!     }
//! }
//!
//! impl<'a, F: hil::flash::Flash + 'a> hil::flash::Client<F> for FlashUser<'a, F> {
//!     fn read_complete(&self, buffer: &'static mut F::Page, error: hil::flash::Error) {}
//!     fn write_complete(&self, buffer: &'static mut F::Page, error: hil::flash::Error) { }
//!     fn erase_complete(&self, error: hil::flash::Error) {}
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! In addition to reading, writing, and erasing pages, most flash chips
//! support locking the chip against writes. This is important, for example,
//! if you want to make sure that a buggy capsule doesn't accidentally
//! overwrite the kernel.
//!
//! Locking is in terms of "units", which can be as small as a single
//! page but are typically much larger (e.g., 6-16 units for the entire
//! flash). If the kernel locks some pages (and does not unlock them), then
//! those pages cannot be written, even by a JTAG programmer; they must
//! be unlocked either by software or by special JTAG commands.
