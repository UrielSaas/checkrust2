# Running Tock on the nRF51822 EK 

This document describes how to install Tock on the nRF51822 evaluation
kit (EK).

The Nordic nRF51822 is a Cortex M0 with an integrated Bluetooth Low
Energy (BLE) transciever. The Firestorm platform has an Atmel SAM4L as
its application processor and an nRF51822 for BLE support.

You should be using the ```nRF51822/working_blinky``` branch.

## Overview

The nRF51822 EK is an ARM mbed device. This means that plugging it
into USB causes it to appear as a SCSI block storage device. To
install a new image on it, you need to create an iHex format and copy
it onto the device, named as `firmware.hex`. When you copy
`firmware.hex` onto the device, it will disconnect and reconnect; mbed
does this because it cannot store files, so wants to trick the OS to
think that the file has disappeared. This also means that if you look
at the device directory, you will never see your firmware.hex.

## Setting up nRF51822 (Linux)

The nRF51822 EK appears as a USB-connected SCSI device. In the Linux
device hierarchy, this means /dev/sd*, where * depends on your
existing SCSI devices.

### Which SCSI device?

To see what device it is, there are two easy ways. First, plug in the
EK. Then, either ```ls -l /dev/sd*```:

```pal@ubuntu:~/src/tock/apps/c_blinky$ ls -l /dev/sd*
brw-rw---- 1 root disk 8,  0 Jul  7 10:01 /dev/sda
brw-rw---- 1 root disk 8,  1 Jul  7 09:43 /dev/sda1
brw-rw---- 1 root disk 8,  2 Jul  7 09:43 /dev/sda2
brw-rw---- 1 root disk 8,  5 Jul  7 09:43 /dev/sda5
brw-rw---- 1 root disk 8, 16 Jul  7 13:55 /dev/sdb
```

In the example above, the computer booted around 9:30AM, and the EK was
plugged in at 1:55. So /dev/sdb is the EK, because its modification time
(when it was inserted) is 1:55.

Alternatively, you can look at the syslog:

```pal@ubuntu:~/src/tock/apps/c_blinky$ dmesg | tail -10
[15086.603849] hid-generic 0003:0D28:0204.0027: hiddev0,hidraw1: USB HID v1.00 Device [MBED MBED CMSIS-DAP] on usb-0000:02:03.0-1/input3

[15087.618765]  sdb:

```
The log messages show that it was added as sdb so can be found at
```/dev/sdb```.

If the device isn't being recognized, you'll need to do some debugging
why.

### usbmount and filesystem

It's easier to deal with the EK as a file system rather than a block
device. One easy way to do this is to install the ```usbmount```
package. This package adds several scripts that make mounting USB
devices easier.

Unplug the EK, install ```usbmount```, and plug the EK back in.

You should now be able to see the EK as a file system mounted at
```/var/run/usbmount/MBED_microcontroller```.

```pal@ubuntu:/var/run/usbmount/MBED_microcontroller$ ls
mbed.htm  System Volume Information```.

### Test Golden Image

Copy ```golden/nrf-golden.hex``` to the EK:

```pal@ubuntu:~/src/tock$ cd golden/
pal@ubuntu:~/src/tock/golden$ cp nrf-golden.hex /var/run/usbmount/MBED_microcontroller/```

Note that this will cause the device to disconnect and reconnect,
and you will not be able to see the file (read above).

Hit the reset button. You should see the two green LEDs blinking
at about 1Hz.
 
## Compiling for nRF51822

To compile an image for the EK, you need to change the TOCK_PLATFORM
variable to ```nrf_pca10001``` (it defaults to firestorm). For
example, to compile the golden image above,

```pal@ubuntu:~/src/tock$ pwd
/home/pal/src/tock
$ make TOCK_PLATFORM=nrf_pca10001 -C apps/c_blinky
```

The EK expects an ihex (named ```firmware.ihex```) rather than an ELF
image. So you need to convert between the two. Standard Tock
compilatiopn puts the image in ```build/nrf_pca10001/```. So, for
example, to convert the c_blinky ELF to the correct format and name:

```$ arm-none-eabi-objcopy -Oihex build/nrf_pca10001/c_blinky/kernel_and_app.elf firmware.hex
```

Then, copy ```firmware.hex``` to the MBED filesystem, as above.
